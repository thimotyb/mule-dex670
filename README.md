# Mule DEX670 Workspace

This repository is my working space for the DEX670 course. I will build the solution incrementally, module by module, across:
- `check-in-papi`: Process API implementation and tests.
- `apps-commons`: Shared Mule components (error handling, health probes).
- `bom` and `parent-pom`: Build/dependency management and deployment defaults.

Each module may evolve as course exercises progress; commits track the incremental steps.
